# Infrasound

Exploring the use of low frequencies sounds in music and films

## Project goal

Isolate sounds of horror movie soundtracks below 20Hz (infrasound) and visualize the use of infrasound in the tracks.

## Project notes
### Notebooks

* [infrasound-project-process-copy.ipynb](analysis/infrasound-project-process-copy.ipynb) summarizes the different techniques used to isolate the tracks below 20Hz and produce the visualizations for the project
* [infrasound-project-process.ipynb](analysis/infrasound-project-process.ipynb) is the notebook actually used for all of the processes but takes too long to render on Github

### Scratchpad Notebooks

* [infrasound-scratchpad.ipynb](analysis/infrasound-scratchpad.ipynb) explores using different packages to import, filter, and visualize sounds including [Spectrum](https://pypi.org/project/spectrum/), [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.spectrogram.html), [AudioSegment](https://audiosegment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/audiosegment.html), [pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/)
* [Spotify-API-scratchpad.ipynb](analysis/Spotify-API-scratchpad.ipynb) explores using the Spotify API to extract songs and information from Horror Films Spotify Playlists
* [Spotify-Preview-URLs-scratchpad.ipynb](analysis/Spotify-Preview-URLs-scratchpad.ipynb) explores parsing and downloading mp3s from list of Spotify 30-second clips
* [Audacity-scratchpad.ipynb](analysis/Audacity-scratchpad.ipynb) explores using Audacity scripts for the low-pass filter
